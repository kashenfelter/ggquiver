## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Corrected capitalisation of 'Quiver' to 'quiver' in the DESCRIPTION's Description.

* Elaborated on 'and more' in the DESCRIPTION, to make it more specific.

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 16.04, R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
